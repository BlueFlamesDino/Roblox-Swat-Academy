# SWAT Academy
This is a repository made to host and support scripts for a [Roblox experince](https://www.roblox.com/games/82367559992760/SWAT-Academy) utilizing [Rojo](https://rojo.space/). This is only setup for scripters as of now, but other roles in development team or anyone are welcome to test, make issues, and participate in discussions.
# Development
### Heads up Developers!
This is a public repository! Never put anything other than Luau code or meaningful comments. Joke comments or of the sort I, BlueFlamesDino, am okay with.
## For Collaborators
- Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
- Have an IDE, Visual Studio is suggested.
- Install the Rojo Visual Studio extension.
- Setup sync between Rojo and Roblox Studio.
- Open or create a Github branch to work on a feature.
## For Non-Collaborators
It is recommended that you join [SWAT Academy](https://www.roblox.com/communities/14884048/Swat-Academy#!/about), our [Discord](), and apply to be a developer.
- Same as a Collaborator, except for the opening or creating branches step.
- Instead fork this repo.
## Developer FAQ
### What Roblox place do I sync to?
- If developement requires the live Place, developers should never connect Rojo's sync to the live Place, instead download a local copy and work from there. If a developer Rojo sync's to the live Place then it can be reverted without any issue apart from just being something to do.
- If development dosen't require the live Place, then just make a new blank Roblox Place and sync. Further development may make some features require specific models or something only found on a copy of the live Place, but a blank Place works just fine as of now.
### I was asked to sync the main branch to the live Place, what do I do?
- A person of higher authority should be able to sync to the live Place such as I, BlueFlamesDino; But if you are asked to sync, simply make sure you have the main branch open and sync.
